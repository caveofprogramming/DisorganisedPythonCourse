"""
Create a class called Media.
Create the following subclasses: Book, Movie, Podcast

Each subclass should contain instance variables appropriate to the type of media, and should be convertible to a string which displays this information.

Create several instances of each class and add them to a container.

Write a program that displays a prompt, like this:

search >

When the user enters a word or phrase, the program searches all Media objects to find a match in their details. If any matches are found, it displays them.

If no matches are found, it prints "No match".

If the user types "quit", the program terminates. Otherwise it displays the prompt again.
