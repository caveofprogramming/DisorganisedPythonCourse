"""
Write a program that asks the user three questions.

Ask the user:
1. Are you a student?
2. Do you have pets?
3. Do you smoke?

The program automatically decides whether a property you've applied to rent is available to you.

It should print an appropriate response, like "Property available" or "Property unavailable".

The program applies these criteria:

If you're a student, you can only rent the property if you don't have pets and don't smoke.

If you're not a student, you can rent the property if you smoke or have pets, but not if you
both smoke and also have pets.
