Write a function that converts feet to miles.

(miles = feet x 1.89E-4)

Using this function, write a program that asks the user to enter a distance in feet and converts it to miles.

If the user enters valid input, print the distance in miles to three decimal places and quit.
If the user enters invalid input, print "Invalid input" and ask them again.

If the user enters "quit", quit the program.
