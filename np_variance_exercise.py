Show that the average value of the variance of small samples actually improves if we use n-1 in the variance formula instead of n

Show that duplicating entries in an array of random values doesn't change if we add duplicate values to the array.

How does variance change if we multiple the entries in a random array by a scalar? How does standard deviation change?

In a (large) array of normally-distributed values with a variance of 1 and a mean of 0, what percentage of the values lie between -1 and 1?
