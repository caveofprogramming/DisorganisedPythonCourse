    It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was 
the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the 
epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the

had heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that 
arrangements were made for the swallowing up of London 
and Westminster.
